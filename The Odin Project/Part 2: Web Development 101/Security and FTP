1) Authenticating Users
2) Creating Secure Connections
3) Securing Databases

HTTPS is an altered version of HTTP which encrypts the data to those who don't have the SSL certificate



Why is security for an application important?
Important data can be stolen

What are the major areas where a web application is vulnerable?
Denial of service attacks, user data in your database, unauthorized access to restricted parts of the site
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Click-Jacking 
Phishing
Shell Injection
SQL Injection

How is HTTPS different from HTTP?
It is 'secure', it encrypts data

What does SSL stand for?
Secure Sockets Layer

What is an SSL certificate?
a bunch of information verifying a user or server's identity that is signed by a trusted third party that allows a user and server to communicate via HTTPS securely
A digital signature that binds a machine's public key with an identity (domain names with public key)


How long has it been since you saw a news headline of a tech company who got "hacked" and exposed millions of user accounts?
Yesterday



TLS: Transport Layer Security, the successor to SSL
uses Public Key Crytography for shared secret generation and authentication
uses Symmetric Key Crytography using shared secrets for encrypting requests and responses


PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION
There are two keys, a private and a public, both are mathematically linked to each other
The public key converts plaintext to ciphertext
The private key decrypts ciphertext into plaintext
The public key can be published freely without compromising the security of the system

Diffie-Hellman allows the two to mix their private and public keys, then exchange, then mix in their secret key with the exchanged mixture to produce a common secret

Public Key Infrastructure: solves the authentication problem
Infrastructures create, manage, distribute, and revoke signed certificates
CA (Certificate Authorities) perform manual inspection and review to ensure the applying entity is a real person/business that exists and is in control of the domain they're applying
for a signed certificate for 
Browsers come preloaded with a list of trusted CAs


HTTPS is also known as HTTP over TLS or HTTP over SSL or HTTP Secure



What is FTP?
File Transfer Protocol
a way of transferring files to and from servers

When is FTP used?
Back then

How is FTP used?
For file transfer


TCP = Transmission Control Protocol
IP = Internet Protocol



FTP protocol is handled by ports 20 and 21 by default
HTTP requests are handled by port 80

FTP can be over ASCII or binary
Text, HTML, CGI is ASCII
Images, applications, .zip/.tar/.sit, .doc/.xls/.fla/.swf files are all binary file types
Both ASCII and binary can be sent in binary
