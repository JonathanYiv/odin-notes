Learning Outcomes
  How do you set the background color?
    using the background-color CSS property

  Which color is used when elements are stacked on top of each other (on the z-axis)?
    the top-most color

  How do you set a partially transparent color? (rgba anyone?)
    rgba or hsla
    provide a fallback color though

  Where are gradients most commonly used in "real world" websites?
    as website backgrounds

  How do you set a gradient background?
    using the linear-gradient() or radial-gradient() functions for the background or background-image properties

  How do you make an image the background of an element?
    using the `background-image` property or the `background` shorthand

  Why is it useful to make the image the background of an element instead of using a regular <img> tag?
    indicates the image is not meaningful semantically

  How do you make a background image of a fixed size?
    background-size property

  How do you make a background image repeat?
    using the shorthand `background` property or the `background-repeat` property

  How do you get your page's background image to fill the page even when you resize the browser?
    background-size specify 'cover' value

Backgrounds
  Solid Color | Image | Gradient | Combination

  div {
    background-color: ...;
  }

  div {
    background-image: url("path/to/image.png");
  }
  by default, the image will repeat horizontally and vertically from the top left
  background-repeat and background-position properties control this

  div {
    ...
    background-repeat: no-repeat|repeat|repeat-x|repeat-y;
  }
  either doesn't repeat, repeats on x and y, repeats on either x or y

  div {
    ...
    /* Positioned at top left by default. Can control position relative to that corner */
    background-position: 20px 10px;
  }
  the first value is the horizontal offset
  the second value is the vertical offset
  if only one value is specified, the vertical offset is default 50%

  0 0                       100% 0
  left top                  right top


  0 100%                    100% 100%
  left bottom               right bottom


  SHORTHAND
    div {
      background: color url position-value-1 position-value-2 repeat;
    }


Gradient Backgrounds
  introduced in CSS3

  Linear Gradient
    div {
      background: linear-gradient(#829484, #823832)
    }

    identified by using the linear-gradient() function within the background or background-image property
    first value includes beginning color value
    second value includes ending color value
    browser handles transition between colors
    do include a fallback incase browser doesn't support gradient backgrounds

    by default, linear gradients move from top to bottom
    can change the direction

    linear-gradient(to right bottom, ...)
      moves from left top to right bottom
      can also use degree values

  Radial Gradient Background
    radial-gradient() function
    work from inside to outside
    first value is center
    second value is outside
    browser creates transition
    can have values for location, size, radius, etc

  Gradient Color Stops
    can add more colors to the gradient function to have the browser transition between multiple colors
    will divide equal distance by default
    can identify a location along the gradient for each color stop (as a length value)

    background: linear-gradient(to right, ..., ... 85%, ...);

Multiple Background Images
  can list multiple images
  the first image will be the foremost
  the last will be the rearmost

  example:
  div {
    background:  url("foreground.png") 0 0 no-repeat, url("middle-ground.png") 0 0 no-repeat, url("background.png") 0 0 no-repeat;
  }


Other Properties
  background-size
    change the size of a background image
    can specify width and height, can use 'auto' to maintain aspect ratio
    can also use `cover` and `contain`
    cover indicates image will be resized to completely cover element's width and height
      can sometimes cut off part of image
    contain indicates image will be resized to be contained WITHIN an element's width and height
      sometimes will not occupy full available size
    both cover and contain can distort the background

  background-clip
    controls where the image is cropped

  background-origin
    where the image is contained within the element
