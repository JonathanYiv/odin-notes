Learning Outcomes
  What is a preprocessor?
    take code written in the preprocessed language and then 'compile to CSS'

  Why do preprocessors rock?
    aren't bound by the limitations of CSS
    like variables, interpolation, mixins, nesting

  What does it mean that a preprocessor "compiles to CSS?"
    it turns the preprocessed language into CSS

  What is SASS/SCSS?
    Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets
    SCSS is SASS3 syntax - everything that works in css works in scss

  How can you use SASS to nest CSS?
    #selector {
      second-selector { property: value; }
    }

  How can you use SASS to work with variables in your code?
    $primary-color: #333333;
    element {
      color: $primary-color;
    }

  Why is it awesome to use mix-ins with SASS?
    you can DRY out your styling code

  If you're not using Rails, how do you set up SASS?
    by installing it

  What is LESS and how is it different from SASS?
    LESS stands for Leaner CSS
    SASS is in Ruby
    LESS is in Javascript

    LESS uses @ for variables
    SASS has Compass/LESS has Preboot
    and there are other syntax differences

  What other preprocessors are out there?
    SASS, LESS, Stylus, PostCSS


SASS Basics
  Includes variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance, and more

  Command Line
    $ sass input.scss output.css
      preprocesses input.scss into output.css

    $ sass --watch input.scss output.css
      every time input.scss is saved with changes, it builds output.css

    $ sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets
      the app/sass directory is watched for changes, then built into public/stylesheets

  Variables
    $variable: value;
    element {
      property: $variable;
    }

  Nesting
    element {
      inner-element {
        ...
      }
    }

  Partials
    _partial.scss
    Partials can be created with little snippets of CSS
    then you can use @import to import them into another file

  Import
    CSS's @import uses another HTTP request
    SCSS's @import combines the files so it is one HTTP request

  Mixins
    create a group of CSS declarations to reuse throughout your site
    can even pass in values

    @mixin name(argument) {
      ...
    }

    element { @include name(parameter); }

  Extension/Inheritance
    share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another
    placeholder classes are classes that only print when extended

    %placeholder-class {
      properties: values;
    }

    element {
      @extend %placeholder-class;
    }

  Operators
    +
    -
    *
    /
    %
