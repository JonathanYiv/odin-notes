Learning Outcomes
  When should you use tables?
    to markup structured tabular data and display it in an easily digestable form

  What is the structure of a table?
    <table>
      <caption></caption>
      <thead>
        <th></th>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
      <tfooter>
        This outlines the content of the table and can be either before or after tbody.
      </tfooter>
    </table>

  What are the special tags that dictate certain parts of a table, e.g. headers or captions?
    <th>

  How can you combine cells in a table?
    using the `colspan` and `rowspan` attributes on the <th> and <td> elements

  Why do you need to be careful about your paddings and borders in tables?
    <tr> elements don't have borders
    <td> elements do have borders
    therefore that can various misalignments
    you have to ensure you place your borders and paddings correctly on each element
    to create a good-looking table

  How do you align text within cells in a table?
    using the `vertical-align` and `text-align` CSS properties

<th>
  The `scope` attribute helps identify what content a table header relates to
    A value of `col` indicates that every cell within the column relates directly to the table header
    A value of `row` indicates that every cell within the row relates directly to the table header

    There are also `colgroup` and `rowgroup` values

  The `headers` attribute helps identify a table element that is associated with a different header if necessary
    You must assign the id attribute to the relevant <th> element


Combining Multiple Cells
  The `colspan` and `rowspan` attributes work on either the <td> or <th> elements and let you combine table cell elements
  Their default value, obviously, is 1

Table Borders
  CSS Properties
    border-collapse
      collapse           - borders condense into one, <td> border is primary
      separate (default) - borders stack up next to eachother
      inherit
    border-spacing
      space between borders when `border-collapse: separate;`
      can accept one or two values (horizontal/vertical)

Adding Borders
  Borders can not be applied to <tr> elements or table structural elements

Striping Tables
  you can alternate background colors on rows to make tables more legible

  you can style using the :nth-child psuedo-class selector with an even/odd argument
  i.e.
    tr:nth-child(even)

  <td> elements include borders while <th> elements do not

Aligning Text
  the CSS property `text-align` centers text horizontally
  the CSS property `vertical-align` centers text vertically only with inline and table-cell elements
    values
      top
      middle
      bottom
