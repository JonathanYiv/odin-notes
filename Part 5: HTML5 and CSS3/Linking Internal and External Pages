Learning Outcomes
	What is the difference between internal links (/somepage) and external links (http://www.somesite.com/somepage)?
		one is relative to the current location
		one is a full set of directions to the resource

	When on a webpage should you use the full URI and when should you use the relative path?
		relative path if the resource is in the same server
		full URI if it is not

	How do you navigate the document tree with links (../../someotherpage)?
		just like the command line

	How do you open links in external windows?
		add `target="_blank" attribute to the <a> element

	What are all the possible pseudo-states (like :hover) of a link and when are they actually activated? How do you change styles based on them?
		Use CSS to change styles
		:link, :visited, :hover, :active, :focus


Relative vs Absolute Paths
	An absolute path is a full set of instructions to the resource
	A relative path is a path relative to the current location as the page being viewed

Link Psuedo-Classes
	:link 		- unvisited links
	:visited	- visited links
	:hover		- mouse pointer on top of link
	:active 	- when the user clicks on the link
	:focus		- when the user tabs to a link or after you click on a link

	Selecting in CSS
		example:
			a:link{
				...
			}

	:link and :visited are actually link psuedo-classes
	:hover, :active, :focus are dynamic psuedo-classes and can be used on other HTML elements

	Selecting Multiple in CSS
		example:
			a:link:hover {
				...
			}

	Suggested Order - to ensure all styling occurs
		a
		a:link
		a:visited
		a:hover
		a:focus
		a:active

		otherwise some might override the others

	Restrictions of Modern Browsers
		:link and :visited cannot differ except for their color properties

		this is because it can be abused in a way that someone can get data about its visitor's briowsing history
