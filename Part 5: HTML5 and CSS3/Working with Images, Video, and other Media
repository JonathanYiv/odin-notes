Adding Media
	Adding Images
		<img> element
			self-contained/empty element -- doesn't wrap around any other content
			must specify 'src' (source) attribute
			'alt' (alternative text) is picked up by search engines and assistive technologies

			most commonly supported are gif, jpg, and png
			most widely used are jpg and png

			jpg = quality images with high color counts with decent file size, ideal for faster load times
			png = images with transparencies or low color counts

			therefore, commonly
				jpg for photographs
				png for icons/background patterns

		Sizing Images
			can specify the 'width' and 'height' attributes in either HTML or CSS
			CSS takes precedence if both are used

			specify only one will cause the other dimension to adjust automatically
			specifying both make break the aspect ratio, causing distortion

			using CSS is best practice

		Positioning Images
			images are, by default, inline-level elements
				will be positioned within the same line as the content that surrounds it
				the height of the line will change to match the height of the image (can cause vertical gaps)

			can use float, display, and box model properties (padding, border, margin) in CSS to modify position

			images are commonly displayed as block-level elements or floated flush to a side

			Block Positioning
				img {
					display: block;
				}

				image will appear on its own line

				Note on Block vs Inline vs Inline-Block

					inline: can display things before or after it, on the same line. 
					block: demands its own line, with whitespace around it. 
					inline-block: can have elements before or after it, but there is whitespace around it.

			Positioning Images Flush Left or Right
