  What are the important properties of fonts that you can specify using CSS?

Font-Face
  lets you use custom typefaces on the web

  @font-face {
    font-family: 'NewFont';
    src: url('NewFont.ttf');
  }

  h1, h2, h3 { font-family: 'NewFont', serif; }

  The font-face declaration explicitly names the font, then can be used accordingly
  The src property points to where the browser can find the font asset



Typeface = the artistic impression of how text looks/feels/reads
Font = file that contains a typeface
Typeface : Font :: Song :: Mp3


Selection
  Important:
    primary typeface
    text color
  Font Properties:
    `font-family` property declares which font to use, including fallback/substitute fonts
    `font-size` lets you set the size of text using pixels, em units, %, pts or keywords
    `font-style: normal|italic|oblique|inherit`
    `font-variant: normal|small-caps|inherit|` will set text in small capitals
    `font-weight: normal|bold|bolder|lighter|inherit|100-900`
      normal = 400
      bold = 700
      note: some typefaces don't have certain weights available
    `line-height` is the distance between two lines of text (leading)
      best practice: 1.5x our font-size, 150% or 1.5
      can also be used to vertically center a single line of text within the element
      use the same property value as height
    shorthand
      `font: font-style font-variant font-weight font-size line-height font-family`
      example:
        font: italic small-caps bold 14px/22px "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif;
  Text Properties:
    `text-align: left|right|center|justify|inherit`
      aligns text within an element
      justify stretches the lines so that each line has equal width
    `text-decoration: none|underline|overline|line-through|inherit`
    `text-indent: 20px;`
    `text-shadow: (horizontal offset) (vertical offset) (blur radius) (color);`
      example:
        text-shadow: 3px 6px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.3);
        casting a 30% opaque black shadow 3 pixels to the right, 6 pixels down, and blurred 2 pixels off all text
      you can chain multiple text shadows using comma separated values
      box-shadow works exactly like text-shadow, but can accept an optional fourth length value for the spread of the shadow
      box-shadow can also include an optional inset value at the beginning to place the shadow inside an element as opposed to outside
    `text-transform: none|capitalize|uppercase|lowercase|inherit`
    `letter-spacing: -.5em;`
    `word-spacing: .25em;`
