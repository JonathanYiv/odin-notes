  What are psuedo-elements and what are they useful for?
    good for styling a specific part of a selected element

Pseudo-Elements
  a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element
    ::first-line is an example

  selector::pseudo-element {
    property: value;
  }

  Others
    ::after, :;before, ::cue, ::first-letter, ::first-line, ::selection

  Experimental
    ::backdrop, :placeholder, ::marker, ::spelling-error, ::grammar-error

  ::after
    lets you insert content onto a page from CSS without it appearing in the DOM
  ::before
    lets you insert content onto a page before any other content without it appearing in the DOM

  ::after/::before
    content: "a string";
    content: url(/path/to/image.jpg);
    content: "";
    counter: counter(li);

Border Radius
  can have 1-4 values
  border-radius: top-left top-right bottom-right bottom-left;
  border-radius: top-left top-right/bottom-left bottom-right;
  border-radius: top-left/bottom-right top-right/bottom-left;
  border-radius: all-corners;

Box Shadow
  box-shadow: none|h-offset v-offset blur spread color |insert|initial|inherit;
    h-offset is the horizontal offset of the shadow, positive on right side of box, negative on left side of box
    v-offset is the vertical offset, positive below box, negative above the box
    blur is optional, makes shadow more blurred
    spread is optional, positive increases size of shadow, negative decreases size
    color is optional, is color of shadow, default value is text color
    inset is optional, changes shadow from outer to inner

  transform: <function>
             none
             matrix
             matrix3d
             translate
             translate3d
             translateX
             translateY
             translateZ
             scale
             scale3d
             scaleX
             scaleY
             scaleZ
             rotate
             rotate3d
             rotateX
             rotateY
             skew
             skewX
             skewY
             perspective

CSS Transitions
  control animation speed when changing CSS properties
    control which properties to animate
    setting a delay
    setting a duration
    setting a timing function

  list of animatable properties: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties

  transition: <property> <duration> <timing-function> <delay>; (comma-separated for multiple)
    the shorthand that controls all the components of transitions, listed below
  transition-property
    specifies the name/names of CSS properties to which transitions are aplied
  transition-duration
    specifies the duration over which transitions occur
    single duration or multiple values for different properties
  transition-timing-function: ease | linear | step-end | steps(4, end) |
    specifies a function to define how intermediate values for properties are computed
    timing functions determine how intermediate values of the transition are calculated
  transition-delay
    defines how long to wait between the time a property is changed and the transition actually begins
