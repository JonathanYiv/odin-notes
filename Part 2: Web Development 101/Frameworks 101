What is a framework?
When developers write solutions in a particular language, then continue to write the same solutions -- they abstract the solutions into a compilation of them so they don't have to redundantly solve the same
problems (you don't have to reinvent the wheel!)
They organize and abstract, and this resource is known as a framework

What's the difference between a programming language and a framework?
A programming language is syntax, grammar, semantics and a core library perhaps -- a framework is a cohesive set of library code that simplifies programming in any given language (a set of tools)

What languages have frameworks?
All of them



Frameworks help solve one of the core tenants of good programming -- "Don't Repeat Yourself" by reducing the amount you have to solve the same problems over and over again
Some famous frameworks include Ruby on Rails, CakePHP, and Django

All frameworks have their own strengths and weaknesses, and you need to evaluate each to see which is the best fit for your needs

To play with a framework, try their tutorials -- you only become proficient with tools after having practiced a lot
