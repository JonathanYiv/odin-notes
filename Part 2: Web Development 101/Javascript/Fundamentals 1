Javascript Variable Declaration
  var x = 3.14;

Numbers
  numbers can be declared with/without decimals
  with/without scientific notation
    i.e. 123e5
  no different types of numbers
  floating point arithmetic is not always 100% accurate
  primitive values

Concatenation
  number + number = number
  string + string = string
  number + string = string

Numeric Operations
  javascript tries to convert strings to numbers in numeric operations
  non-addition, as that is concatenation above

NaN (Not a Number)
  JS reserved word
  not a legal number
  a mathematical operation with a NaN results in NaN or concatenation
    isNaN(x); // returns true if not a number

Infinity
  number outside the largest possible number

Hexadecimal
  0x...

==
  checks for equal value
===
  checks for equal value AND type
Objects can't be compared with == or ===, always returns false


Operands: numbers in an arithmetic operation
Operation: operation to be performed between two operands
Operator: definition of operation type


Javascript has operator precedence values that may affect left-to-right parsing
so keep that in mind


typeof(x);
  determines the data type of the input

Increment/Decrement Operators
  ++
  --
  can not be applied directly to a number
  must be used on a variable
  returns the current value, then increments the variable
  can be placed before/after a variable (prefix returns the new value/postfix returns the old value)

Assignment Operators
  =
  +=
  -=
  *=
  /=
  Assignment operators returns the assigned value

Unary: an operator with a single operand (-5)
Binary: an operator with two operands (5 - 3)

Unary +
  +(value)
  will convert value into a number, if not already a number


Chaining Assignments
  a = b = c = 2 + 2;


Comma Operator
  (5 + 2, 3 + 4)
  both expressions are evaluated
  only the last result is returned
  needs parenthesis because comma operator has low precedence


Variable Declaration
  the `let` keyword is the modern variable declaration that should be used generally
    example:
      let message = "hello";
      alert(message); // returns message
      let message = 'Sup', age = 5, test = "fire";

  the `var` keyword is very similar to `let`, with some small differences

  Naming Conventions
    1) Only letters, digits, $, and _
    2) The first character can not be a digit
    3) camelCase
    4) case-sensitive

  the `const` keyword declares a constant unchanging variable
  fully uppercase constants are commonly used as aliases for difficult-to-remember values
