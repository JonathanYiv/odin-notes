What exactly does testing mean for web applications?
It means writing tests that determine whether functionality of the web app is maintained despite changes

Why is testing important?
It automates QA processes and reduces bugs/breaking, helps you learn legacy code, and write better code

What is legacy code?
Old, shitty code

Why is writing tests particularly powerful for legacy code?
It helps make it manageable and lets the code evolve and be refactored

What is RSpec?
A popular ruby testing framework
DSL (Domain Specific Language): added additional language features on top to make the language optimal for testing code


How do you run a RSpec test suite?
How do you write a basic RSpec test?



TDD Steps
1) Write an automated test for new functionality that fails
2) Change the code so the test will pass
3) Verify all tests passes
4) Refactor when needed

Test Driven Development means writing a failing test first, then making the test pass, then refactoring the code
Red -> Green -> Refactor
Never write new functionality without a failing test



Unit Tests: small independent tests that verify a small amount of functionality

Test-First Development helps accomplish both specification and validation (meaning it can validate that you pass the tests and since you wrote the test first, helps you specify your requirements)

Test = Specification aka Spec



rspec:
expectations == assertions

TDD = Refactoring + TFD
