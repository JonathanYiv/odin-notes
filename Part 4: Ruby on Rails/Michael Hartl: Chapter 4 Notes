IMPORTANT NOTE: Shift + Insert is paste in the terminal, Ctrl+Shift+C is copy in the terminal

HELPERS
	if a helper is specific to a particular controller, put it in the corresponding helper file

	example:
		a helper for the Example controller should go in app/helpers/example_helper.rb

	if the helper will be used on all pages, it should go in /app/helpers/application_helper.rb


RAILS ENVIRONMENTS
	There are three environments defined by Rails
		Development
		Test
		Production


STRINGS
	strings are the most important data structure for web applications

	STRING LITERALS
	"" = empty string
	"a" = nonempty string

	You can concatenate or interpolate
		note: Ruby won't interpolate into single-quoted strings

	'puts' = put string 

	single-quoted strings are useful because they are truly literal


METHODS
	most methods won't change the variable itself
	to mutate the variable, use a "bang" method ("bang" == !)


TIP: %w(this is a string array)

CLOSURES
	Blocks are closures
	Closures are one-shot anonymous functions with data attached


SHORTHAND: "Symbol to Proc"

	%w[A B C].map { |char| char.downcase }
	is equivalent to
	%w[A B C].map(&:downcase)
		& calls to_proc on the symbol, which is passed as a block to the method


Note on Symbols: As opposed to strings, which are compared character by character, symbols are compared all at once. This makes them ideal as hash keys


Note on Inspect:
puts object.inspect
has a shortcut
p object


Note on Hashes: When hashes are the LAST argument in a function call, the curly braces are optional

stylesheet_link_tag 'application', { media: 'all',
                                     'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' }

is equivalent to

stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all',
                                   'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload'


                                this has two arguments:
                                	a string indicating a path to the stylesheet
                                	a hash with two elements indicating the media type and telling rails to use the turbolinks feature added in Rails 4.0



CONSTRUCTORS
	literal constructor
		examples:
			""
			{}
			[]
	named constructor
		calls new on the class name
		examples:
			String.new
			Hash.new
			Array.new


	#new is a Class Method



BLANK?
	#blank? is a method added to the String class by Rails
	if the string is only composed of whitespace or nil, it will return true

	this is opposition to #empty? which will return false if a string is only whitespace


Note: initializing objects using a hash argument is known as mass assignment and is common in Rails applications
