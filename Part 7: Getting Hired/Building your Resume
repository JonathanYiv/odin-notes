Your resume is not a catch-all repository of your whole life -- it is a focused marketing tool designed to make you seem worth taking another look at


Need to emphasize relevant education, work experience, and projects that crafts a story of drive and capability


Resume To Do
	Reduce resume content to one page -- remove the mediocre stuff and leave the best stuff
	Use bullet points, one to two lines - NO PARAGRAPHS
	Accomplishment-oriented, my impact, NOT my responsibilities
		Quantify accomplishments
	Top 3-5 Projects
	List languages and technologies


Write cover letters that are passionate, specific, and personally customized for the job you are applying for

1: Come across as a human being, NOT a list of jobs and programming languages
	the more human you are, the more the person processing your data will relate to you
