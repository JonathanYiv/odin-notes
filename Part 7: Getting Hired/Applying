Apply daily with a few applications per day
	Learn from any mistakes you can identify based on feedback from the process
		Try again

Set a definite goal of applications per day

Start at the bottom of your desired list and work your way up

Do NOT use their online resume drop but instead identify a HUMAN BEING at the company and connect with that person somehow

For some companies that you REALLY want, tailor a project towards them
	Visit their local events
	Find out what they sponsor
	don't be a stalker but be proactive

	You can go weeks without hearing any responses
		then you can get an interview, and fail, and you feel horrible
			it is very inconsistent

Do NOT sound desperate
	no matter what!


Email cover letters should be concise, to the point, but excellent

Maybe create an intro video?
