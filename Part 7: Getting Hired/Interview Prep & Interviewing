The best interviews are enthusiastic conversations with technical depth

Always prepare!
	Know what questions you will be asked
		and the general responses
	Research the company
		Tailor your pitch to their needs
		Ask intelligent questions about their product/technology when the time comes


The Funnel
	1) Phone Screen
	2) Technical Interview
	3) Technical Challenge
	4) Fit Interviews
	5) Job Offer
	6) Offer Negotiation
	7) Offer Acceptance


Phone Screens
	used as an initial employment screening technique

	Have your resume and cover letter in front of you

	Shower, groom, get dressed, and stand up -- your mindset matters

	Have a cheatsheet with q/a, statements, expectations, etc

	be on time

	find a quiet place

	smile, and focus on listening

	speak clearly

	follow-up

	Five Essential Questions you will Face
		1) Coding
			write some simple code
		2) OO Design
			know basic OO concepts and come up with classes to model a simple problem
		3) Scripting and Regexes
		4) Data Structures
		5) Bits and Bytes


	Coding Examples:
		Write a function to reverse a string.
		Write function to compute Nth fibonacci number.
		Print out the grade-school multiplication table up to 12x12.
		Write a function that sums up integers from a text file, one int per line.
		Write function to print the odd numbers from 1 to 99.
		Find the largest int value in an int array. 
		Format an RGB value (three 1-byte numbers) as a 6-digit hexadecimal string.
		FizzBuzz

	Data Structures:
		Arrays
		Vectors
		Linked Lists
		Hashtables
		Trees
		Graphs

		Big-O

	Bits:
		2^16 = 65536


Tech Interview
	the best asset you have is honest and intellectual curiosity

	when trying to solve a problem, do so in a clear and logical way, explaining out loud why you are doing each step

	If you would plan to google for a particular function, then say so

	use brute force initially

	If you don't know something, say so, and work with your interviewer to figure it out
