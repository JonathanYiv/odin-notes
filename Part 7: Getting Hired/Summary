Tips
  1) For a career transition, you will face skepticism, so craft a narrative that identifies the underlying themes and connections between the past/present. Explain your trajectory in terms of the value you bring to others.
  2) Be descriptive about portfolio projects: name, code, tech stack, languages, skills necessary, etc.
  3) Bring hard copies of code examples.
  4) Cover Letters should be: Passionate, Human, Personally Customized for Job, Concise, and Excellent
  5) Have technical depth: know what I don't know
  6) Prepare specific and intelligent questions for the interviewer
  7) If you don't know something, be honest
