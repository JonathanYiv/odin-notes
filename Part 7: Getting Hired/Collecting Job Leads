Use an organization system to keep track of the jobs and their pertinent data as well as your corresponding activity with them
Rank the jobs
and qualify based on your personal criteria

Places to Look
	1) Network
	2) Direct Postings that go to a Human 
	3) Direct Postings on Websites that go to a Filtering System/Recruiter
	4) Job Boards (worst, but the more technically focused, the better)

Recruiters increase in value as you get more experience
	as a junior, not really, rely on yourself
