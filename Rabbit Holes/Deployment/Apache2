  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost

    DocumentRoot /var/www
    <Directory />
      Options FollowSymLinks

  default virtual host is configured to handle any request on port 80, standard http port

  apache uses the most specific virtual host definition that matches the request
