Container
  Row
    Column

Containers
  > containers are centered and horizontally padded
  > .container has a responsive pixel width
  > .container-fluid has a width of 100%

Rows
  > Rows are wrappers for columns
  > each column has horizontal padding (aka gutters) between them
  > you can remove margin/padding with .no-gutters
  > you can add .align-items-center .align-items-start .align-items-end .justify-content-center etc

Columns
  > Content must be placed inside a column
  > Columns must be direct children of rows
  > Column Classes can be specified .col-4 uses 4/12 columns in a row
  > You don't have to specify the number of columns or viewport, and it will produce an auto-layout
  > .col-(breakpoint)-auto to size based on content width
  > .w-100 is a column line break
  > you can specify different column divisions for different breakpoints
  > columns will wrap
  > you can offset columns with .offset-md-4 or something

Breakpoints
  > apply to that one breakpoint and all those above it
  > i.e. .col-sm-4 applies to small and up devices, but not xs devices
