# Apache mod_rewrite
Uses a rule-based rewriting engine (based on regex) to rewrite requested URLs on the fly.
Supports unlimited rules and unlimited rule conditions.

Operates on the full URLs both in per-server context (httpd.conf) and per-directory context (.htaccess).

This is a very complex module.

# Conclusion

OK...
Since I'm only using Apache2 temporarily... and will be using Nginx shortly...
I'll just not learn this.
