Containers
> Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents and house the grid system
> containers are not nestable
> .container is a responsive fixed width container
> .container-fluid is a full width container


Grid System
> 12-Columns

> Rows are placed within a container
> Rows are used to create horizontal groups of columns
> Content is placed inside columns
> ONLY columns may be immediate children of rows

> .row, .col-xs-4 are examples of predefined classes for grid layouts
> three .col-xs-4 would create three equal columns

> columns have gutters

> if > 12 columns are placed in a row, the columns will wrap onto a new line

> grid classes apply to devices with screen widths GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO the breakpoint size
> they override smaller breakpoints

> you can nest rows


Clearfix
> Sometimes you will need to use .clearfix


Offsetting Columns
> .col-md-offset-* classes increase the left margin of a column by * columns
