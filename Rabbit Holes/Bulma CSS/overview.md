# Usage
1) Import Sass Variables
2) Set your own Variables
3) Import Bulma

# CSS Classes
Bulma is a collection of CSS classes.
The HTML code has NO IMPACT on the styling of your page.
That's why classes like `.input` exist so you CHOOSE which elements you want to style.

Exceptions:
* `generic.sass`
* `.content`
