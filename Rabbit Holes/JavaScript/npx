npm@5.2.0 includes a new binary: npx

npx is a tool to simplify a variety of things that used to take more effort with npm

npx <command>
  runs your local installation

npx <command>
  also automatically installs a package with that name from the npm registry for you and invokes it
  when done, the installed package won't be in your globals, to reduce long-term pollution
  useful because by the time you run a command again, you'll have to run an install to update them
