const
  `const` does not indicate a value is 'constant' aka 'immutable'
  the BINDING is immutable
  using an assignment operator, --, or ++ throws a TypeError exception

primitive values are always immutable

to make an object's values immutable
  Object.freeze()
    this freezes the object on a shallow level


1) Use const by default
2) Only use let if rebinding is needed
3) var shouldn't be used in ES6
