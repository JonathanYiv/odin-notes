Interaction Design: the structure and behavior of interactive systems
  Unlike UX Design, interaction design is ONLY concerned with the interactions between a user and a screen
  Although, in practice, these things are never so clearly delineated

Methodologies
  Goal-Driven Design
  Usability
  The Five Dimensions
  Cognitive Psychology
  Human Interface Guidelines

Goal-Driven Design
  Highest Priority: problem solving
  > satisfying specific needs and desires of the end-user
    1) Design first; program second
    2) Separate responsibility of design from programming
    3) Hold designers responsible for product quality/user satisfaction
    4) Define one specific user for your product
    5) Work in teams of two

Usability
  Highest Priority: ease of use

  Interpretation 1: Three Principles
  > Learnability: ease of learning the interface
  > Flexibility: ways users can interact with the system
  > Robustness: quality of support for errors

  Interpretation 2: Five Principles
  > Learnability
  > Efficiency: perform tasks quickly
  > Memorability: how memorable is the interface
  > Errors: how many errors do users make, and how quick do they recover
  > Satisfaction: do users enjoy the interface

  Interpretation 3: Five Principles (ISO)
  > Learnability
  > Understandability
  > Operability: amount of control user has
  > Attractiveness
  > Usability Compliance

The Five Dimensions
  1D: words should be simple to understand and be effective communication
  2D: visual representations are all graphics/images, that should be used in moderation
  3D: physical hardware, such as the mouse/keyboard
  4D: time, length spent interacting with the first three dimensions, as well as measurement of progress
  5D: behavior, emotions/reactions a user has

Cognitive Psychology
  Mental Models: images in a user's mind that inform their expectation of a certain interaction
  Interface Metaphors: make use of known actions to lead users to new actions
  Affordances: things that are designed to look like they will do something

Tasks
  1) Design Strategy
  2) Wireframes
  3) Prototypes
  4) Stay Current
  5) Follow Industry Leaders

Typography
  1) Check font capabilities
  2) Font fallbacks happen on a character basis
  3) Use <strong> and <emphasis>, not <b> and <i>
  4)
