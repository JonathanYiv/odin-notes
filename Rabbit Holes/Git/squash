# `$ git commit --amend`
* opens an editor with the last commit message, allowing you to modify it
* replaces the previous commit with this updated commit
* useful for adding files/modifications/changing descriptions

# Squash: `$ git rebase -i <branch>`
* re-applies commits, one by one, in order, from your current branch onto another
* `--interactive` or `-i` is a flag which opens the editor with a list of commits that are about to be changed

pick fa20af3 git interactive rebase, squash, amend

# Rebase 8db7e8b..fa20af3 onto 8db7e8b
#
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
#  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
#  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
