DNS
  Domain Name System
  networking system in place that allows us to resolve human-friendly names to unique addresses

Domain Name
  the human-friendly name associated with an internet resource

IP Address
  network addressable location
  must be unique within its network (in the case of websites, the entire Internet)
  IPv4 is the most common form of the address
    four sets of number, each set having up to three digits, each set separated by dots
    111.222.111.222
  DNS maps a name to an address so you don't have to remember the numbers

Top-Level Domain (TLD)
  the most general portion of the domain
    .com
    .net
    .gov
    .org
    .edu.io
  top of hierarchy in domain names
  ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) assigns control to parties over to-level domains
    these parties can distribute domain names under the TLD, through a domain registrar

Hosts
  within a domain, the domain owner can define individual hosts (separate computers/services)
  bare domain: example.com
  host definition: www.example.com

SubDomain
  DNS works in a hierarchy
  TLDs can have many domains; domains can have subdomains
  example: ubuntu.com is a subdomain of com
  example 2: ubuntu is the second-level domain (SLD) of ubuntu.com

  host vs subdomain
    host defines a computer/resource
    subdomain extends the parent domain

FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) aka Absolute Domain Name
  an absolute name that specifies its location in relation to the absolute root of the DNS
  example: mail.google.com.

Name Server
  a computer designated to translate domain names into IP addresses
  may redirect requests to other name servers or delegate responsibility

Zone File
  text file that maps domain names and IP addresses
  reside in name servers

Records
  within a zone file, records are kept
  a record is a single mapping between a resource and a name
  can map a domain name to an IP address, define the name servers for the domain, define the mail servers for the domain, etc

_____________________________

Root Servers
  at the top of the DNS hierarchy
  13 root servers in operation
  handle requests for Top-Level Domains
  when a request comes in that a lower-level name server cannot resolve, the query is made to the root server for the domain (.org, .com, etc)
  the root server will direct the requester to the appropriate TLD server (.org)

TLD Servers
  the TLD server is one level below root servers and will also point the requester to the name server (example.org)

Domain-Level Name Server
  this server has the actual IP address of the resource
  it returns the IP address to the requester

Resolving Name Server
  a server configured to ask other servers questions
  it caches query results and root server addresses to improve speed

  browsers first check locally for resource locations, then sends it the resolving name server, which checks it cache, then speaks to the appropriate root, then TLD, then domain-level name server accordingly to obtain the IP address


_________________________________

Zone Files
  where name servers store information about domains
  will either return the answer or the next name server to look at next

  describes a DNS 'zone,' a subset of the entire DNS system

  they have an $ORIGIN - zone's highest level of authority (domain.com.)
  and a $TTL - "Time to Live" of the information it provides, it caches the queried result until the TTL value runs out

Record Types
  there can be many different record types within a zone file

  SOA Record
    "Start of Authority"
    mandatory record in all zone files
    must be the first record in a file

domain.com.  IN SOA ns1.domain.com. admin.domain.com. (
                                            12083   ; serial number
                                            3h      ; refresh interval
                                            30m     ; retry interval
                                            3w      ; expiry period
                                            1h      ; negative TTL
)
    Explanation
      domain.com.
        the root of the zone
        specifies the zone file is for the domain.com. domain
        can be replaced with `@`, which is a placeholder for the $ORIGIN variable

      IN SOA
        the "IN" means "internet"
        SOA indicates the type of record

      ns1.domain.com.
        defines the primary master name server for this domain
        name servers can be masters or slaves
        if dynamic DNS is configured, one server needs to be a primary master

      admin.domain.com
        the email address of the administrator for this zone
        your.name@domain.com => your\name.domain.com

      12083
        serial number for the zone file
        every time a zone file is edited, this number must be incremented
        slave servers check if the master server's serial number is larger than theirs, and if so, requests the new one

      3h
        the refresh interval for the zone
        amount of time that slaves wait before polling the master for zone file changes

      30m
        the retry interval for this zone
        if the slave can't connect the master when refresh interval is up, it waits this time to retry

      3w
        expiry period
        if slave can't contact master of this period of time, it no longer returns responses as a sourcec for this zone

      1h
        time that a name server will cache a name error if it cannot find the requested name in this file

  A and AAAA Records
    map a host to an IP address
    "A" record maps a host to an IPv4 address
    "AAAA" record maps a host to an IPv6 address

host     IN      A       IPv4_address
host     IN      AAAA    IPv6_address

    explanation:
      oftentimes 'host' will be `www`
      sometimes it will be the subdomain ('api.example.com')
      @ can refer to the base domain
      * can resolve anything that is not defined explicitly

  CNAME Records
    define an alias for canonical name for your server (one defined by an A/AAAA record)

server1     IN  A       111.111.111.111
www         IN  CNAME   server1
(alias)                 (canonical name)

    recommended usage is when an alias is needed for a resource outside of the current zone

  MX Records
    define the mail exchanges used for the domain
    allows emails arrive at your mail server correctly

IN MX 10 mail.domain.com

    apply to the entire zone

    preference number that helps computers decide which server to send mail to if there are multiple mail servers
    lower preference numbers have higher priority

    MX record should point to a host defined by an AAAA/A record

        IN  MX  10  mail1.domain.com.
        IN  MX  50  mail2.domain.com.
mail1   IN  A       111.111.111.111
mail2   IN  A       222.222.222.222

  NS Records
    defines the name server used for this zone
    DNS often caches copies of zone files
    so other servers may have this zone file, and the zone file defines the original name server

        IN  NS     ns1.domain.com.
        IN  NS     ns2.domain.com.
ns1     IN  A      111.222.111.111
ns2     IN  A      123.211.111.233

    need at least NS records

  PTR Records
    defines a name associated with an IP address
    inverse of an A/AAAA record

444.333.222.111.in-addr.arpa.   33692   IN  PTR host.example.com.

  CAA Records
    specifies which Certificate Authorities (CAs) are allowed to issue SSL/TLS certificates for your domain
    all CAs are requried to check for these records before issuing a certificate
    otherwise all CAs may issue a certificate
