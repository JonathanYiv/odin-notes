Introduction to Kubernetes
	Containers are baby computers inside another computer (server)
	Benefits: resource isolation and efficient server use, abstracts away your infrastructure

	Kubernetes is an organization of the containers
	Pods consist of one or more containers on one node/server and are always coupled together
	One pod is reached through an IP address

	A deployment is multiple pods
	Services join together to route to deployments

	Ingress controller handles external internet traffic and sends it to different services

	YAML files define the attributes of everything at every layer

Note to Self: If I ever do a presentation, it must have value beyond just reading about it in an article online

WebAssembly
	efficient, low-level bytecode for the web
	extremely small file-size
	code is compiled into bytecode before sent to the browser
	safe and portable

	because browsers use JIT (Just in Time) compilers to optimize Javascript, it is not recommended to compile JS into WASM

	Other languages don't have JIT advantage, so they should be compiled into WASM

	It is best for heavily CPU bound computations (video encoding, games, etc)

REST vs GraphQL
	All graphQL requests are POST requests
	queries are structured like JSON
