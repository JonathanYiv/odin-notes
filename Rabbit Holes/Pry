REPL: Read, Evaluate, Print Loop
	an interactive programming environment which takes a user's inptu, evaluates it, and returns the result to the user
	IRB is a REPL which is shipped with Ruby

Pry vs IRB
	IRB is an external REPL where you have to type in new code
	PRY is like a REPL that you can inject into your program (more flexibility)

Binding
	A Built-in Ruby class whose objects can encapsulate the context of your current scope (variables, methods, etc) and retain them for use outside of that context
	binding.pry is essentially prying into the current binding/context of the code from outside of your file
	the binding.pry line will get interpreted at runtime, and the program will FREEZE and your terminal will turn into a REPL that exists right where you binding.pry line is
