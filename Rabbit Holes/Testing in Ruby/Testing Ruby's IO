1) There are three constants
STDIN
STDOUT
STDERR

there #fileno => 0,1,2 respectively

2) There are three global variables
$stdin
$stdout
$stderr

They point to the same thing as STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR respectively

3) puts, gets, print
gets = stdin.gets
print = stdout.print
puts = stdout.puts

4) Why two variables?
By assigning another IO object to one of the global variables, we can temporarily redirect the IO elsewhere
Then we can always restore the original behavior by setting the global variables back to equal the corresponding constant
