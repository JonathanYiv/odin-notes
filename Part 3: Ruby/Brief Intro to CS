Points to Ponder
What is an algorithm?
a set of instructions to solve a problem

What is psuedo-code?
english-like syntax that represents a programming language

Computer Science: the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers
It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasability, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures/algorithms that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information
THE STUDY OF AUTOMATING ALGORITHMIC PROCESSES THAT SCALE

Algorithm: a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed (actions include calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks)
it is an effective method that can be expressed within a finite amount of space/time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function
